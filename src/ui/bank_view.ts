// Pure view-core for the desktop Bank window (#bank), the per-character deposit
// box read off the IWorld bank mirror. DOM/Three/i18n-free: it maps the
// proximity-gated BankInfo snapshot (null away from a banker) to a flat render
// model the thin painter (bank_window.ts) draws, and decides the slot click
// action (a whole withdraw vs the shift split-stack prompt). Registered in
// UI_PURE_CORES; unit-tested against both Sim- and ClientWorld-shaped inputs in
// tests/bank_view.test.ts. Mirrors the bags_view / mailbox_view pure-core split.

 *  does not FULLY fit is skipped, not partially deposited, and sets `full`. Partial
 *  deposits would have to re-derive the sim's countFit stacking math, which this must

 *  fully fit (moveBetweenContainers' countFit gate), so whole-stack-or-skip matches it
 *  exactly. Iteration is DESCENDING by index so each successful move's source splice
 *  only shifts indices ABOVE the one just removed (already processed): every recorded
 *  slot index stays valid when the caller replays the sends IN THIS ORDER against the
 *  live world.
