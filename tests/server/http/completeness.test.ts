// Registry-completeness gate for the Phase 9 API pipeline (docs/api-pipeline/).
//
// The Phase 9 dispatcher (server/http/dispatch.ts) places the new route registry
// in FRONT of the legacy /api handleApi ladder: for a path the registry OWNS (a
// matched RouteDef) it runs the onion; for ANY OTHER /api path it delegates to
// the legacy handleApi UNCHANGED. So the dispatcher's real coverage is
//   (router-owned paths) UNION (paths the legacy handler still serves).
//
// This gate HARD-FAILS if any legacy /api ladder path (from the Phase 3 surface
// inventory) would be served by NEITHER the new router NOR the legacy delegate: a
// dropped route is a production 404. It stays meaningful as routes migrate,
// because each route moves from delegate-covered to router-owned and coverage is
// checked against BOTH arms, so a migration that adds a router route without
// removing the legacy arm (double-serving) or removes the legacy arm without a
// matching router route (a gap) is caught here.
//
// The coverage decision is factored into a pure isCovered() helper, and a
// negative-control block feeds it a synthetic dropped route to prove the gate is
// NON-VACUOUS (it can actually fail). The legacy-served set is re-derived
// independently from server/main.ts SOURCE (the same extraction technique as
// surface_inventory.test.ts, read as a file, never imported), which gives the
// gate teeth against a future dropped dispatch arm.
