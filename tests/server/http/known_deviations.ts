// Known deviations ledger for the API pipeline re-architecture (Phase 3 spine).
//
// This is the CHARACTERIZATION counterpart to the surface inventory: where the
// inventory records WHAT routes exist and the goldens record WHAT they emit
// today, this ledger records the places where today's behavior is a DELIBERATE
// deviation, either one a later phase intentionally changes (introducedInPhase
// names the phase that lands the change) or one preserved by design forever
// (introducedInPhase null). It changes no runtime behavior; it is a planning and
// freshness artifact so the later phases land their changes against a written
// baseline instead of an unstated assumption.
//
// Anchoring rule: every entry's `routes` strings are exact paths that MUST exist
// in SURFACE_INVENTORY (the test cross-checks this), and every `goldenFixtures`
// path MUST point at a fixture that exists on disk (the test cross-checks that
// too). Entries never anchor on line numbers.
//
// Stable-code rule: this ledger CHARACTERIZES the codes/strings the server emits
// today. It does not add, rename, or localize any error code or catalog entry
// (Phase 7/22 own that). The `currentBehavior` text describes what exists.

// Named deviation ids (no scattered inline strings; one source of truth, the
// inventory and tests refer to these constants).
